# Message to be sent when the bot is sent a message that isn't nicely formatted or made
INVALIDMESSAGETOBOT = '''Sorry, but it looks like the message you sent is invalid.

This bot has several actions, many of which ~~are pretty neat~~ can be seen below:

Command|Example Subject|Example Body|Description
:------|:--------------|:-----------|:----------
ADD|ADD::AskReddit||If you run this command, you will be added to the messaging list for a given subreddit, and will thus recieve a message when this subreddit sends out an update message.
REMOVE|REMOVE::AskReddit||Running this command will remove you from a given subreddit's mailing list.
SEND|SEND::AskReddit New Rules!|There has been a rules update. Check it out.|This will send a message to everyone on the mailing list for the mentioned subreddit, with the anything past the command in the subject being parsed as the subject for the output message. This will only work if you are a moderator of the subreddit you are mentioning.
DISCORD|DISCORD::AskReddit|https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/...|A Discord webhook link so that different updates will post into your Discord channel.

This bot will not be able to parse a response to this message, so thus you will have to make a completely new message should you wish you correct any mistakes you made in sending this initially.

Have a nice day! c:''' + BOTDISCLAIMERMESSAGE
